Flutter plugin that creates a moon widget according to the moon's phase.

```dart
        MoonWidget(
          date: DateTime.now(),
          resolution: 128,
          size: 64,
          scale: 0.2,
          moonColor: Colors.amber,
          earthshineColor: Colors.blueGrey.shade900,
        ),
```
